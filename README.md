# Trello Clone with Next.js

This project is a Trello Clone developed using Next.js, and the OpenAI API. It allows users to create cards to manage their tasks and projects in a visually organized way.

## Demo

You can access the live demo of the Trello Clone [here](https://trello-clone-piax.vercel.app). You might need to wait a few seconds for Chat GPT's summary to be displayed.
